This is the component you'll need installed in Foobar2000 to provide information to NyawPlaying.

It is a modified version of [`foo_catnap`][1], with a bug fixed, new fields, and changed port/name to avoid conflicts (just in case).

**Note:** This component may require:

* Update Foobar2000 to the latest version
* Installing VC++ runtimes (you probably already have them)
